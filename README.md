# Urban Access: Rent vs. Food Availability in U.S. Cities

This project explores the relationship between rising rent prices and access to affordable food across U.S. ZIP codes. Using public datasets from Zillow and the USDA Food Access Research Atlas, it builds a complete ETL pipeline from raw data ingestion to a PostgreSQL warehouse with analysis-ready outputs.

Built with Python, SQL, and CLI tools, this project demonstrates core data engineering skills: data extraction, cleaning, transformation, loading, and automated workflows. Insights can help inform policymakers, NGOs, and urban planners about food deserts and affordability issues in urban areas.
